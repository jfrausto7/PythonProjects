# PythonProjects
A collection of various Python Projects that I created and worked on in my spare time.

## covidTable
This tool scrapes data about COVID-19 cases and then presents it in a neat table format. Written in Python, covidTable parses data with Beautiful Soup. Afterwards, the data is presented with the texttable module.

## Weather Scraper
Weather Scraper is a tool that fetches the current temperature and other useful information of any city in the United States. It's a data scraping project written in Python. Weather Scraper retrieves data using GeoPy, parses it through Beautiful Soup, and finally returns it to the user in a simplified form.

##TwitterBot
TwitterBot is, simply put, a Twitter Bot that I created. It utilizes Tweepy and the Twitter API along with OAuth to collect and produce tweets. On top of this, extensive error handling is needed in order to successfully run TwitterBot.
I personally have TwitterBot on my laptop set to run 7 times a day automatically with Automator. This tweets to the account @CelebrityJumble, which I made for this project.
