# PythonProjects
A collection of various Python Projects that I created and worked on in my spare time.

## covidTable
This tool scrapes data about COVID-19 cases and then presents it in a neat table format. Written in Python, covidTable parses data with Beautiful Soup. Afterwards, the data is presented with the texttable module.

## Weather Scraper
Weather Scraper is a tool that fetches the current temperature and other useful information of any city in the United States. It's a data scraping project written in Python. Weather Scraper retrieves data using GeoPy, parses it through Beautiful Soup, and finally returns it to the user in a simplified form.
